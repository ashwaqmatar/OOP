Monom : In mathematics, a monomial is, roughly speaking, a polynomial which has only one term . Two definitions of a monomial may be encountered:
1.	power product : is a product of powers of variables with nonnegative integer exponents
2.	coefficient :  is a monomial in the first sense multiplied by a nonzero constant

Polynom : is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables

Graph of a function f : is, formally, the set of all ordered pairs (x, f(x)), such that x is in the domain of the function f, and, in practice, the graphical representation of this set.
We can find all the points on the graph Through investigation of function after that drow it

The purpose from this project, to calculate the value of various operations to the polynom function: subtract, root, multiply….

we did all the testing of the function through gui testing.
